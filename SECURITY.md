## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please publish all possible vulnerabilites, bugs, etc to the [Issues](https://github.com/Jaysparrr/Script-Comparison-Utility/issues) page.

I am a one man team! I may not always see issue reports due to school, work, etc... but I will try my best to not let any reports go unnoticed within the first 12 hours of submission.

Thank you!
